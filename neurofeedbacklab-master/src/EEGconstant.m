%Because my laptop has a 'hybrid' graphics card, psychtoolbox can't run
%proper tests on Windows. Try running the code without the following line,

%wan't to see if you can fix it using the instructions provided by the 
%command 'help SyncTrouble'

%% Settings %%
%Modify the following settings as you wish or use the default settings:

%Monitor in use, returns a value counting from 0, 1, 2 etc.
%By default, it uses the monitor with the highest assigned value, which
%most likely will be an external monitor. Set to 0 if you want to use the
%main monitor (unnecessary if there is only one).

%Maze pattern
%An MxN array is randomly generated and the values are used as coordinates
%for each "pixel". For a 16:9 display (a typical widescreen monitor),
%M=N=110 is ideal. For a 16:10 display, try M=N=90. This ensures that the 
%dots will fill the entire screen, although note that some systems might
%struggle with animating so many pixels.
M = 110;
N = 110;
sc = 30; %Scaling factor, controls the size of each maze pixel. Note that
         %smaller pixels will require a larger MxN. It's also recommended
         %that you reduce MxN when sc is increased for performance reasons.
